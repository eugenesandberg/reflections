How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Less code to go through.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    See how the code evolved. Learn from how the file evolved.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    No cons. Pros are: Commits at logical changes. You can add comments.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files with code are often closely related whereas text files in Google docs are often standalone.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to bring up the commits and their IDs. Use the IDs in git diff to see the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can easily revert.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    write some code and commit
